# onvif-rest-api-go

The REST API (with notes) of [ONVIF protocol](https://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver20/util/operationIndex.html), with some architecture concessions for simple integration with [Nightbot](https://nightbot.tv/)

Under the hood [ONVIF protocol](https://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver20/util/operationIndex.html) is, I think I may say, a SOAP API.

Go definitions is generated by [gowsdl tool](https://github.com/hooklift/gowsdl).

# How to run

### 1. Clone and build image

```
docker build -t onvif-rest-api-go:latest .
```

### 2. Configure docker-compose

Make changes in `docker-compose.yml` file according to your needs

### 3. Run docker-compose

```
docker-compose up -d
```

# Implemented operations

Main focus is to provide transparent transition from SOAP to REST. So not many validations implemented.
